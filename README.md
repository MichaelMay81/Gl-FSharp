Converted OpenGl tutorials to F#.
* [Silk.NET](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET/tree/main/examples/CSharp/OpenGL%20Tutorials)
  * 12 out of 13 tutorials (omitted model loading)
* [OpenTK](https://github.com/opentk/LearnOpenTK)
  * Chapter 1: all 9 tutorials
  * Chapter 2 maybe in the future...
 
F# features:
* Tried to keep to functional principals (no mutable if not necessary, no classes)
* Result computational-expression
* Units of measure for degrees and radians
